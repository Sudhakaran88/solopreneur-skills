## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when the user mentions:

- Customers cancelling, wanting to reduce cancellations
- Building or improving a cancellation flow
- Setting up save offers or retention offers
- Failed payments, dunning, payment recovery
- Win-back campaigns for churned users
- Exit surveys and cancellation feedback
- Adding a pause subscription option
- Measuring or diagnosing churn rate
- Identifying at-risk users before they leave
- Involuntary churn or billing-related churn

---

## Context Check

Before giving tactical advice, ask (or infer from context):

1. **What type of product?** (B2B SaaS, B2C tool, community, course platform)
2. **What billing model?** (monthly, annual, usage-based, freemium-to-paid)
3. **What is current monthly churn rate?** (or do they not know yet)
4. **What billing stack?** (Stripe, Paddle, Chargebee, Lemon Squeezy, manual)
5. **Do they already have a cancellation flow?** (just a button, or a flow with save offers)
6. **What is their primary growth channel?** (paid, organic, referral — affects how costly churn really is)

Do not assume they have engineering resources. Default to no-code / low-code solutions wherever possible.

## Churn Types Defined

Understanding which type of churn you are dealing with determines the entire intervention strategy.

### Voluntary Churn
Customer actively decides to cancel. Causes include:
- Product does not deliver expected value
- Too expensive for perceived ROI
- Found a better alternative
- No longer needs the product (use case ended)
- Poor onboarding — never reached activation

**Fix lever:** Cancellation flow, save offers, better onboarding, product improvement.

### Involuntary Churn
Customer did not intend to cancel — payment simply failed. Causes include:
- Expired or outdated card
- Insufficient funds (especially month-end)
- Bank fraud flag or issuer block
- Card number changed after reissue

**Fix lever:** Dunning email sequence, smart payment retries, in-app payment update prompts.

### Product Churn (Disengagement Before Cancellation)
Customer stops using the product but has not cancelled yet. This is a leading indicator — disengaged users churn within 30-60 days without intervention.

**Fix lever:** Usage-based triggers, re-engagement emails, feature nudges, personal outreach.

## Churn Benchmarks by Segment

Use these as reference points, not targets. Context matters (pricing, market, stage).

| Segment | Monthly Churn | Annual Churn | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMB SaaS | 3–5% | 36–60% | Normal but needs work |
| SMB SaaS (best-in-class) | <1% | <12% | Excellent |
| Mid-Market | 1.5–3% | 18–36% | Typical |
| Enterprise | 0.5–1.5% | 6–18% | Expected range |
| B2C / Consumer SaaS | 5–8% | High | Very hard to retain |
| EdTech | Up to 9.6% monthly | Very high | Structurally difficult |

**Key benchmarks to internalize:**
- Monthly churn above 3% for SMB SaaS is a warning signal — you are losing a third of your base annually
- Annual churn below 5% across all segments is considered gold standard
- Involuntary churn represents 20–40% of total churn — this is money left on the floor
- Customers on annual plans churn at roughly 1.5% less per year than monthly customers

## The 4 Levers of Churn Prevention

Churn prevention is not a single tactic. It operates across four sequential stages. Solopreneurs should prioritize in this order:

```
LEVER 1: Onboarding → Prevent churn before it starts
LEVER 2: Engagement → Catch disengagement early
LEVER 3: Save → Intercept cancellation intent
LEVER 4: Recover → Reclaim failed payments + win back churned users
```

Most solopreneurs focus only on Lever 3 (the cancel button). The highest leverage is actually Levers 1 and 4.

---

## At-Risk User Signals

You cannot save users you cannot see. Build a simple mental model or lightweight tracking system around these signals:

### High-Priority Signals
- Login frequency drops by 50%+ over 2 weeks (e.g., daily → weekly)
- Core feature usage stops (the feature that defines activation)
- Failed payment in the last 7 days
- Support ticket with frustration or "this doesn't work" language
- No login in 14+ days on a monthly plan
- Downgraded from a higher plan recently

### Medium-Priority Signals
- Has not used the product in 7 days (monthly plan)
- Has not completed onboarding checklist after 14 days
- Opened cancellation-related help docs
- Asked about refunds or billing in chat

### Simple Tracking for Solopreneurs (No Engineering Required)
- Use Stripe webhooks + a simple spreadsheet or Notion database to flag users who haven't logged in (if your app tracks logins via events)
- Tools like Baremetrics, ChurnKey, ProsperStack, or MRRSaver can automate at-risk identification directly from your billing data
- If you use Intercom, Crisp, or Helpscout: tag users when they ask billing questions — this is a reliable churn predictor

**Rule of thumb:** If a user who was previously daily becomes weekly, intervene within 72 hours. After 30 days of disengagement, recovery probability drops below 20%.

---

## Cancellation Flow Design

A cancellation flow is the sequence a customer experiences from the moment they click "Cancel" to either completing cancellation or being retained.

### The 3-Step Structure

```
STEP 1: Intent Capture → Confirm they mean to cancel + show what they'll lose
STEP 2: Save Offer   → Present a single, reason-matched offer
STEP 3: Exit Survey  → If they proceed, capture why (do not gatekeep this)
```

### Step 1: Intent Capture
- Ask: "Are you sure? Here's what you'll lose access to:" and list 3-5 specific things (not features — outcomes)
- Show usage stats: "You've processed 47 invoices this month" or "Your last report saved you 3 hours"
- Do NOT: make cancellation confusing, require a phone call, or hide the cancel button (dark patterns destroy trust and reputation)

### Step 2: Save Offer
- Display ONE offer only — multiple options cause decision paralysis
- Match the offer to the exit reason (see Save Offer Types below)
- Make it one-click to accept — every extra click reduces conversion by ~15%
- Do not repeat the same offer more than once — if they decline, respect it

### Step 3: Exit Survey
- Keep it to 1 primary question: "Why are you cancelling?" with 5-7 preset reasons
- Add one optional free-text field
- Do NOT make this required — blocking exit surveys are a legal risk and a trust destroyer
- Every additional question after the first drops save rate by ~6-7%

**Expected results with a well-built flow:** 15–30% save rate. Top performers with personalized, reason-matched offers achieve 30–42%.

### Tools for Building Cancel Flows (No-Code Friendly)
- **ChurnKey** — plug-in cancel flow with save offers and dunning, works with Stripe
- **ProsperStack** — Stripe-native cancel flow and save offer management
- **Raaft** — lightweight cancel flow builder
- **MRRSaver** — affordable option designed for solopreneurs and small SaaS
- **Custom (Typeform + Stripe API)** — DIY option, 3-5 hours to build

## Save Offer Types

Match the offer to the stated cancellation reason. Generic discounts underperform because they address price, not the actual problem.

| Cancellation Reason | Best Save Offer |
|---|---|
| Too expensive | 20–30% discount for 3 months, or annual plan at discount |
| Not using it enough | Pause subscription (30–60 days, no charge) |
| Missing a specific feature | "We're building this — here's early access / a roadmap preview" |
| Switching to competitor | Feature comparison + free migration help offer |
| Temporary cash flow issue | Pause or 1-month free extension |
| Business not going well | Pause + personal check-in email |
| Doesn't understand the product | Offer a 15-minute onboarding call or free done-for-you setup |

### Discount Guidelines
- Limit discounts to 20–40% — a 40% discount performs nearly identically to 50% in save rate, so protect margin
- Time-box discounts (3 months, not permanent) — permanent discounts devalue the product and train price sensitivity
- Do not offer discounts to users with high support costs or low activation — you are not solving their problem, just deferring it

### Pause Subscription (Underused but High-Converting)
- A pause option (30–90 days) saves accounts that would otherwise cancel with no intention to return
- During a pause: their data stays intact, payment pauses, you send a "we miss you" email at the 30-day mark
- Works especially well for: seasonal businesses, freelancers with fluctuating income, early-stage founders between projects
- Implementation: Stripe supports subscription pauses natively

### Human Outreach (Highest-Converting for High-Value Accounts)
- For accounts paying $50+/month, a personal email from the founder converts at 2–5x higher than an automated offer
- Template: "Hey [Name], I saw you were thinking of cancelling — I'd love to jump on a 10-minute call to understand what's not working. No sales pitch. Just want to make sure we can fix it."
- This is a superpower solopreneurs have that growth-stage companies do not

## Involuntary Churn and Dunning Sequence

Failed payments represent 20–40% of all churn. Most solopreneurs ignore this entirely and leave substantial ARR on the table.

### What Causes Failed Payments
- Expired card (most common — cards expire, customers forget to update)
- Insufficient funds (month-end is highest risk)
- Bank fraud flag (issuer blocks unfamiliar charges)
- Card reissued after theft or loss

### Smart Retry Logic
Stripe's built-in Smart Retries use machine learning to pick optimal retry times. Enable this in your Stripe settings under **Revenue Recovery > Smart Retries**. This alone recovers 15–25% of failed charges without any email.

Do not retry the same amount at the same time repeatedly — vary timing:
- Retry 1: A few hours after failure (temporary decline / bank glitch)
- Retry 2: 3 days later (avoids weekend bank processing delays)
- Retry 3: 7 days later (paycheck cycle — funds may be replenished)

### Dunning Email Sequence

Send this alongside retry attempts. First email within 1 hour of failure — speed is the single highest-impact variable.

| Day | Tone | Key Message |
|---|---|---|
| Day 0 (within 1 hr) | Friendly / matter-of-fact | "Your payment didn't go through. Update your card here." |
| Day 3 | Slightly urgent | "Your subscription will pause if payment isn't resolved by [date]." |
| Day 7 | Value reminder | "You'll lose access to [key feature] — here's the quick fix." |
| Day 14 | Final notice | "Last chance — account will be cancelled on [date]." |

**Tone guidelines:**
- Email 1: Assume it is a mistake. No blame. Make the fix 1 click.
- Email 2–3: Raise urgency without sounding threatening
- Email 4: Be clear and final — give the exact cancellation date

**In-app prompt:** If your app has a logged-in state, show a persistent banner immediately after payment failure. This is higher-converting than email alone because it reaches users at the moment of value.

### Stripe vs Custom Dunning
| | Stripe Smart Retries + Built-in Emails | Custom Dunning Tool (Baremetrics, ChurnKey) |
|---|---|---|
| Setup time | 10 minutes | 2–4 hours |
| Cost | Included in Stripe | $30–$100/month |
| Personalization | Low | High |
| Recovery rate | 15–25% | 30–50% |

**Recommendation for solopreneurs:** Start with Stripe's built-in tools. Once MRR exceeds $3K/month, a dedicated dunning tool pays for itself in recovered revenue within weeks.

---

## Win-Back Email Sequence

Win-back targets users who completed cancellation. The optimal window is 2–6 weeks post-churn — they've had time to feel the absence of your product, but haven't fully settled into an alternative.

**Realistic expectation:** 5–15% of churned users can be reactivated via win-back email.

### Segmentation Before You Send
Do not send the same win-back to everyone. Prioritize:
- High-engagement users who cancelled (most likely to come back)
- Users who cancelled for fixable reasons (price, missing feature now shipped)
- Users who cancelled due to a pause-worthy situation (seasonal, cashflow)

Skip win-back for users who: never activated, had high support costs, or were on a deeply discounted plan.

### Win-Back Sequence (4 Emails)

**Email 1 (Week 2 post-churn): Acknowledge + Curiosity**
Subject: "What happened, [Name]?"
Body: Brief, genuine. Ask what went wrong. No offer yet. Shows you care.

**Email 2 (Week 3): What's New**
Subject: "We fixed the thing you mentioned" (or "Here's what's new since you left")
Body: 2-3 product improvements. If you know their churn reason, address it directly.

**Email 3 (Week 4): The Offer**
Subject: "Come back — here's [discount/free month/new feature]"
Body: One clear offer with a deadline. Make it effortless to reactivate (one click to Stripe).

**Email 4 (Week 6): The Close**
Subject: "Last chance — offer expires [date]"
Body: Short. Final. Respectful. If no response after this, move them to a low-frequency "product news" list (monthly) — do not hammer unengaged contacts.

## Exit Survey Design

Exit surveys are intelligence, not just a retention tool. Every cancellation is free product research.

### The 7 Canonical Cancellation Reasons (Pick 5-7 for your product)
1. Too expensive / not worth the price
2. Not using it enough to justify the cost
3. Missing a feature I need
4. Found a better alternative
5. Technical issues or bugs
6. Too complicated to use
7. My business / project has changed — I no longer need this

### Design Rules
- 1 mandatory question (pick a reason), 1 optional free-text field
- Do NOT add more — each extra question reduces completion and save rate
- Route save offers based on selected reason (see Save Offer Types section)
- Aggregate results monthly: the most common reason is your product roadmap signal

### What to Do With the Data
| Top Exit Reason | Action |
|---|---|
| "Too expensive" | Test pricing page clarity, add value messaging, consider annual plan discount |
| "Missing a feature" | Add to roadmap, email users when shipped (win-back trigger) |
| "Found a better alternative" | Run competitor comparison analysis |
| "Not using it enough" | Fix onboarding and activation — this is a value delivery problem |
| "Too complicated" | UX audit, add onboarding checklist, offer setup call |

## Common Mistakes

**1. Only having a cancel button — no flow**
The single highest-leverage improvement most solopreneurs can make in an afternoon. A basic cancel flow with one save offer takes 2–4 hours to set up and immediately captures 15–30% of churning users.

**2. Ignoring involuntary churn**
Most solopreneurs look at churned users and assume it was a product decision. In reality, 20–40% of that churn was a failed credit card. Check Stripe's revenue recovery dashboard before assuming you have a product problem.

**3. Offering blanket discounts**
Discounting every churning user trains your customer base to cancel and wait for a deal. Use discounts only when exit reason is price. For every other reason, offer a solution, not a price cut.

**4. No pause option**
A pause is often the right offer for users who love the product but can't use it right now. Without it, they cancel. With it, they come back. Adding a pause option typically captures an additional 5–10% of churning users that discounts miss entirely.

**5. Building a cancellation experience that's confusing or hostile**
Dark patterns (hidden cancel buttons, fake urgency, forced calls) generate complaints, chargebacks, and public negative reviews. These hurt acquisition costs far more than the customers you'd retain through manipulation.

**6. Not doing anything with exit survey data**
The exit survey is the most honest product feedback you will ever receive. If you collect it and never act on it, you are leaving both product intelligence and win-back opportunities unused.

**7. Blasting all churned users with the same win-back email**
Targeting low-engagement, low-value churned users with win-back campaigns damages email deliverability and wastes time. Segment ruthlessly — focus on high-engagement users who left for fixable reasons.

---

## Contrarian Takes

**"Discounting saves customers" — Not always.**
Discounting retains users who are price-sensitive, not value-convinced. If they churn anyway at the end of the discount period, you've just deferred the loss while reducing your LTV. A pause, a personal call, or a feature unlock often outperforms a discount — and does not erode pricing integrity.

**"Cancellation flows are manipulative" — The bad ones are. The good ones are helpful.**
A cancellation flow that asks why you're leaving and offers a genuinely useful alternative (pause, downgrade, a quick call) is serving the customer. The goal is not to trick them into staying — it is to make sure they know their options before they leave. Most users who cancel don't know pausing exists.

**"Reducing churn starts with a great offboarding experience" — Yes, but the real work starts 90 days before.**
By the time someone clicks cancel, the decision is usually made. The highest-leverage churn prevention work happens at activation (did they reach value?) and at the 30-day disengagement signal (did you notice and intervene?). Most solopreneurs only think about churn at the cancellation screen.

**"Involuntary churn is not your fault, so don't worry about it" — Wrong.**
Failed payment recovery is the closest thing to free money in SaaS. It requires no product improvement, no marketing spend, and no sales skill. It is purely an operational system. A 30-email dunning sequence and smart retries can recover 30–50% of failed payments. Not having this system is a deliberate choice to leave revenue uncollected.

## Quick Wins (Prioritized for Solopreneurs)

Implement in this order for fastest ROI:

1. **Enable Stripe Smart Retries** (10 minutes, free) — immediate involuntary churn recovery
2. **Add a pause option** to your cancel flow (2 hours) — captures 5–10% of churners you'd otherwise lose
3. **Set up a 4-email dunning sequence** (3–4 hours) — recovers 20–40% of failed payments
4. **Build a basic cancel flow** with exit survey + one save offer (half day) — saves 15–30% of cancellations
5. **Send a manual win-back email** to your top 10 churned users from the last 60 days (1 hour) — 5–15% reactivation, no automation required
6. **Add a login-frequency alert** in Stripe + your email tool (1–2 hours) — catch at-risk users before they cancel
7. **Review exit survey data monthly** and address the top reason — compound improvement over time
