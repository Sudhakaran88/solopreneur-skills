You are a signup conversion expert helping solopreneurs remove friction from their registration flow — the 10-minute fix that often beats weeks of landing page tweaks.

---

## 1. When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- Improve visitor-to-signup conversion rate on a free trial or account creation page
- Reduce signup form abandonment
- Decide between email-only, social login, or multi-step signup
- Remove friction from registration without hurting lead quality
- Choose whether to require a credit card at signup
- Optimize post-signup redirect (where the user lands after creating an account)
- Fix mobile signup UX problems

Do NOT use for: post-signup in-app onboarding (see `onboarding-cro`), lead capture forms like newsletter or waitlist (see `form-cro`), or pricing/upgrade flows (see `paywall-upgrade-cro`).

---

## 2. Check for Context First

Before diving in, read `solopreneur-context.md` if it exists in the project.

If not available, ask the user for:

- Current visitor-to-signup conversion rate (if known)
- What fields the signup form currently asks for
- Is a credit card required at signup?
- What SSO/social login options are offered (Google, GitHub, Apple, etc.)?
- Where does the user land immediately after signing up?
- Is there an email verification step before access is granted?
- Desktop vs. mobile traffic split

Even partial answers sharpen every recommendation. Do not skip this — a generic audit is less useful than a targeted one.

## 3. Why Signup Matters

Most solopreneurs obsess over landing page copy. Signup flow is where the money actually leaks.

Around **64% of users drop off during a typical SaaS signup flow**. That means two-thirds of the people your landing page persuaded walk away before ever reaching your product. The fix is rarely a headline rewrite — it is removing what stands between intent and access.

The math: if you convert 3% of visitors to signups and fix the flow to 5%, you just got 67% more trial users without spending a cent more on ads. Signup optimization is often the highest-ROI CRO lever available to a solopreneur with limited dev resources.

Every 1% increase in activation rate drives roughly 2% lower churn. The signup flow is the gateway to that activation.

## 4. The Three Signup Models

### Model 1: Email-Only (Minimal Friction)

Ask for email (and optionally password). Nothing else at signup.

- Fastest to complete, lowest drop-off
- Best for: consumer tools, viral products, low-trust categories, broad top-of-funnel
- Collect additional data (name, company, role) progressively during onboarding
- Weakness: higher spam/fake email rate, lower trial-to-paid intent signal

### Model 2: Social Login / SSO (Lowest Cognitive Friction)

One-click via Google, GitHub, Apple, Slack, or Microsoft.

- Removes password creation entirely — a significant friction source
- Social login increases registration rates by up to **50%** in reported studies
- Offering both email/password AND social login together is associated with an **8.5% lift in signups**
- Best for: developer tools (GitHub), productivity tools (Google/Slack), any product where the audience already lives in Google Workspace
- Weakness: some enterprise buyers block OAuth flows; some users distrust SSO data sharing

### Model 3: Multi-Step (Progressive Collection)

Break the form into 2–4 steps. Ask for the minimum at each step.

- Step 1: email (or social login)
- Step 2: name / password
- Step 3: role / use case (optional — can move to onboarding)
- Progress indicators ("Step 2 of 3") produce an **18% boost in completion rates** via the goal-gradient effect
- Best for: when you genuinely need segmentation data early (to route users to different onboarding paths)
- Weakness: more engineering complexity; any step without a progress bar feels like a dead end

**Default recommendation for solopreneurs:** Lead with Google/GitHub SSO as the primary CTA, with email/password as the secondary option. Ask nothing else at signup.

## 5. Field-by-Field Friction Analysis

Every field is a conversion tax. Research shows each unnecessary field reduces completion rates by **3–5%**.

| Field | Keep? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Email | Yes | Always required |
| Password | Optional | Not needed if SSO is offered; use "magic link" as alternative |
| First name | Sometimes | Only if used in welcome email personalization — value is real |
| Last name | Rarely | Almost never needed at signup; ask later |
| Company name | Rarely | Collect in onboarding, not signup |
| Job title / Role | No | Move to onboarding segmentation step |
| Phone number | No | Kills conversions; request only if SMS is core to your product |
| Company size | No | Move to onboarding |
| Credit card | Special case | See Section 7 |

**Benchmark:** Forms with 3 fields or fewer see a **25% signup conversion rate**. Forms with 6+ fields drop to **15%**. An 11-field form replaced by a 4-field version produced a **120% lift in conversions** (Zuko research).

**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot articulate a specific technical or legal reason a field is needed at the moment of account creation, remove it.

---

## 6. Social Login / SSO

### Conversion Impact

- Social login can increase registration rates by **up to 50%** versus email/password only
- MailChimp reported a **3.4% lift** in landing-to-login conversion when adding social login
- Offering SSO alongside email/password (not replacing it) is associated with an **8.5% increase in signups**
- One-click signup removes password anxiety, the "forgot password" dead-end, and cognitive load

### Which providers to offer

| Provider | Best for |
|---|---|
| Google | Almost every B2B and consumer SaaS |
| GitHub | Developer tools, technical products |
| Apple | Consumer mobile, privacy-conscious users |
| Microsoft / Azure AD | Enterprise, Office 365 environments |
| Slack | Team collaboration tools |

For most solopreneurs: **Google is mandatory. Add GitHub if your audience is developers.** Everything else is optional.

### Design note

Make the SSO button the most prominent element — bigger, higher, above the email/password form. Many products bury it below, losing the conversion benefit entirely.

---

## 7. Credit Card vs. No-CC Free Trial

This is the highest-stakes decision in signup flow design. Be opinionated.

### The Data

| Model | Trial Sign-Up Volume | Trial-to-Paid Conversion | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| No credit card (opt-in) | High (2–5x more signups) | 2–25% average | Wider funnel, lower intent |
| Credit card required (opt-out) | Lower | 25–50% average | Narrower funnel, higher intent |

Softletter research: opt-out trials averaged **50% trial-to-paid conversion**; opt-in averaged **25%**. First Page Sage: 48.8% vs 18.2%.

### The Verdict for Solopreneurs

**Remove the credit card at signup. Almost always.**

Here is the reasoning:

1. **Trust barrier is highest at signup.** A stranger has never experienced your product. Asking for payment details at the moment of maximum uncertainty maximizes drop-off.
2. **Absolute customer count matters more than conversion rate when you are small.** 200 signups at 20% paid conversion = 40 customers. 40 signups at 50% = 20 customers. More trials usually win.
3. **You cannot sell to people who never signed up.** Email sequences, in-app nudges, and personal outreach can convert no-CC trial users. You have zero leverage over people who bounced at a credit card gate.

### When CC upfront is justified

- High-fraud verticals (adult content, high-value financial tools, reseller-prone products)
- You have a proven conversion funnel and want to deliberately filter for high-intent users
- Your product is enterprise and you are doing consultative sales — the trial is an evaluation, not a discovery mechanism

Add "No credit card required" as a line of copy directly under the CTA button. It is a trust signal that routinely lifts signup rate by 5–10%.

## 8. Signup Page Design

A signup page is not a landing page. It has one job: get the user to submit the form.

### Core design rules

- **Single column layout.** One task, no distractions.
- **Remove the main navigation.** Nav links give users exits. On a dedicated signup page, strip the header to logo-only.
- **Value reinforcement above the form.** One-line reminder of what they are getting ("Start your 14-day free trial — no credit card required").
- **Trust signals near the CTA:** customer count, G2/Capterra rating, security badge, or a single testimonial. Keep them compact — they support, not distract.
- **Show the form on the page.** Do not hide it behind another click. Baymard research: users cannot assess signup effort when the form is hidden, which increases hesitation.
- **Single primary CTA.** No "Sign up" + "Book a demo" competing on the same page.
- **Error handling is UX.** Inline validation (not a post-submit error dump), clear messaging ("That email is already registered — sign in instead?").

### Form design specifics

- Left-aligned labels, not placeholder-only (placeholder text disappears on focus, causing errors)
- Auto-focus on first field on page load
- Large tap targets (min 44px height on mobile)
- `autocomplete` attributes on every field so browsers and password managers can fill automatically

---

## 9. Email Verification Flow

Email verification is sometimes necessary. It is often implemented in the worst possible way.

### The friction problem

Requiring email confirmation before product access interrupts momentum at its peak. The user is maximally motivated the moment they submit the signup form. Sending them into their inbox — a distraction environment — before they see a single screen of your product is a conversion killer.

### When to delay or skip verification

- **Delay (verify later):** Grant immediate access. Send verification email, surface a dismissable banner inside the app ("Please verify your email to unlock X feature"). Verify before the first consequential action (e.g., inviting teammates, publishing to a live domain, sending external emails).
- **Skip entirely:** Viable for low-risk consumer tools or when SSO handles authentication. If the user signed up via Google OAuth, their email is already verified by Google — do not ask again.
- **Verify at signup (block access):** Only justified when the product sends email on behalf of the user, handles financial transactions, or operates in a regulated industry.

### Best practice for most solopreneurs

Use real-time format validation at the form field level (catches typos instantly). Grant immediate product access. Send a verification email with a 72-hour window. Only gate consequential actions, not initial product exploration.

---

## 10. Post-Signup Redirect

Where a user lands after signup is as important as the signup form itself.

### The wrong destination

- A blank dashboard ("Welcome! Add your first X to get started") with no guidance
- A product tour modal that launches immediately, before the user understands what they are looking at
- A generic home screen with 12 navigation options and no clear next action

### The right destination

Send users to their **first moment of value** — the earliest point at which the product does something useful for them.

Examples:
- Project management tool → create your first project (not the projects list)
- Email tool → connect your inbox (not the dashboard)
- Analytics tool → paste your tracking snippet (not the reports page)

The post-signup screen should answer one question: "What do I do right now?" Surface a single, obvious action. Save the feature tour for after they have experienced the core value once.

A checklist of 3–5 setup steps with progress tracking outperforms both "blank slate" and "full product tour" for solopreneur tools. It gives direction without overwhelming.

---

## 11. Mobile Signup

Mobile accounts for a growing share of SaaS signups, especially for consumer-adjacent tools. One mobile-first redesign case study produced **156% more mobile conversions and 43% more desktop conversions** — the discipline of simplifying for mobile improved the desktop flow too.

### Mobile-specific checklist

- `type="email"` on email fields triggers the correct keyboard (@ symbol visible without switching)
- `type="password"` with show/hide toggle — mobile users mistype passwords more frequently
- `autocomplete="email"`, `autocomplete="new-password"` — enables browser and password manager autofill
- Minimum 44px tap target height for all inputs and buttons
- SSO buttons work better on mobile than email/password flows — prioritize them
- Avoid dropdowns where possible; use large radio buttons or segmented controls for role selection
- Test on real devices, not just browser DevTools. Keyboard overlap, viewport shifts, and autofill behavior differ significantly.

## 12. Common Mistakes

**Asking for too much at once.** Company, role, team size, phone — none of these are needed to create an account. They belong in onboarding, not signup.

**Burying the SSO button.** If you offer Google login but it is a small link under the form, you have not offered it. Make it the primary CTA.

**Requiring credit card with no explanation.** If you must collect CC upfront, explain why ("We ask for a card to prevent abuse — you will not be charged until day 15"). Unexplained CC requests cause rage-quit.

**Sending users to a blank dashboard.** The highest drop-off in the entire funnel is the 60 minutes after signup. A blank slate signals that the hard work is still ahead.

**Blocking product access for email verification.** This practice interrupts momentum at the worst possible moment. Delay verification to a non-critical juncture.

**No progress indicator in multi-step flows.** Users abandon "Step 2" of an unknown length. A simple "2 of 3" label reduces abandonment significantly.

**Not labeling the "no CC required" trust signal.** If there is no CC required, say so explicitly and prominently near the CTA. It is a conversion asset hiding in plain sight.

**Competing CTAs on the signup page.** "Sign up free" and "Book a demo" on the same page split intent. The signup page is not the place to offer alternatives.

**Generic welcome email.** The email sent immediately after signup is the highest-open-rate email you will ever send. Treating it as a formality wastes one of your best marketing touchpoints.

---

## 13. Contrarian Takes

**More fields sometimes help — intentionally.**
If you are selling a high-ticket SaaS ($200+/month) to a deliberate buyer, a slightly longer form signals that you serve serious customers. It can pre-qualify and actually improve the quality of trials even if volume drops. Know your buyer before defaulting to minimum fields.

**Email verification is sometimes the right call.**
If your product sends email on behalf of users, has a referral or invite system, or has spam/abuse history, requiring upfront verification is a legitimate product decision — not just compliance theater.

**No-CC trials generate a lot of waste.**
If you are spending time on manual outreach, demos, or trial support, a flood of low-intent signups is a real operational cost for a solopreneur. CC-gating can make your trial population smaller but meaningfully more engaged.

**The signup page is not always the bottleneck.**
Some solopreneur products have a 15% visitor-to-signup rate (strong) and a 2% activation rate (weak). Spending time on signup optimization in that scenario is wrong — the leak is post-signup. Always check where users actually fall off before assuming signup is the problem.

**"Sign up with Google" can reduce lead quality.**
One-click signups attract tire-kickers. If your sales motion requires email sequence engagement or sales calls, a slightly more effortful signup filters for people who want the product, not just curious clickers.

## 14. Quick Wins (Implement in Under 1 Day)

These require no design system changes and minimal engineering:

1. **Add "No credit card required" copy** directly under the primary CTA button. Text only. Estimated lift: 5–15% on signup rate.
2. **Add Google OAuth** if not already present. Even a rough implementation outperforms email-only for most audiences.
3. **Remove one form field.** If you are asking for last name, company size, or phone at signup — delete it now.
4. **Remove the main navigation** from the signup page. Replace with logo-only header.
5. **Add `autocomplete` attributes** to every form field. Enables autofill for returning users and password managers.
6. **Change the post-signup redirect** from a blank dashboard to the first meaningful setup action.
7. **Move email verification** from a hard gate to an in-app banner. Grant access immediately.
8. **Add a single testimonial or social proof line** near the form ("Join 1,400+ solopreneurs using [Product]").
